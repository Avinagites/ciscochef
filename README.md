This is a web application that shows a dynamically created
map of places that my Cisco coworkers and I have deemed worthy
of eating at around the San Jose campus. It's responsive, meaning
that it will look great on computers, smartphones and tablets.
This map will benefit not only employees at Cisco, but als
people around the Bay Area.

## TODO list

For this leg of the project, the focus is to make the app
solid and resilient to failure. Here are the remaining tasks:

- Create documentation for REST API
- Enable API keys (optional)
- Refine routing layer for Sinatra

Some goodies would include the following:

- Create 404, 503, ... custom pages for Sinatra
- Enable a custom domain like www.ciscochef.com
- Refine UI/UX of homepage via CSS
