This is a web application that shows a dynamically created
map of places that my Cisco coworkers and I have deemed worthy
of eating at around the San Jose campus. It's responsive, meaning
that it will look great on computers, smartphones and tablets.
This map will benefit not only employees at Cisco, but also
people around the Bay Area.

## TODO list

For this leg of the project, the focus is to make the app
efficient and resilient to failure. Here are the remaining tasks:

- Create documentation for REST API with wiki or doc software
- Create unit tests and model helpers as necessary
- Enable Continuous Integration
- Optimize Sinatra's routing logic

Some goodies would include the following:

- Create 404, 503, ... custom pages for Sinatra
- Enable a custom domain like www.ciscochef.com
- Enable API keys
- Refine UI/UX of homepage via CSS
