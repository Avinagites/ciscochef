This is a [web application](http://ciscochef.herokuapp.com/) that shows a dynamically created
map of places that my Cisco coworkers and I have deemed worthy
of eating at around the San Jose campus. It's responsive, meaning
that it will look great on computers, smartphones and tablets.
This map will benefit not only employees at Cisco, but also
people around the Bay Area.

## TODO list

For this leg of the project, the focus is to make the app
clean, elegant and resilient. Here are the remaining tasks:

- Enable a custom domain like www.ciscochef.com
- Enable API keys
- Refine UI/UX of homepage via CSS
